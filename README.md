## ðŸ“Š Sorting Algorithm Visualizer


Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive and visually engaging web application designed to demystify the working of popular sorting algorithms through real-time, step-by-step animations. It serves as an educational tool for beginners and enthusiasts to intuitively understand how data is sorted, observe algorithm behavior, and compare performance visually. With a clean UI and dynamic controls, users can select algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and moreâ€”watching each step unfold with colorful, animated transitions.
